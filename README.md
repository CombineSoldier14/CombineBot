## What is it?
CombineBot is a full free and open source discord bot made by me. It has 30+ slash commands for moderation and fun, perfect for any server.

It is updated as often as I can (when I actually know what to do that is) and is COMPLETELY free.

## Features!
* MBTI Test command
  * Find your Myers-Briggs Personality type using this command with a test made completely by me!
  * Cognitive Function/Enneagram test coming soon!
 
* Practicality comes first
  * The bot has a primary focus on tons of moderation and server/role management commands, making it the perfect fit or any server owner or moderator.

* No premium or paid features
  * This bot is completely 100% free and open source, and always will be. Useful services such as these should always be free and with the supplied Dockerfile you can host your own instance too!

* Make your own embed command
  * Actually create an embed with a title, description, footer, and HTML color tag to get your messages out there and be recognized!

* An actually easy calculator command
  * It makes use of a math parsing library that allows you to just type your equation and have it solved!

* Lots of API fun!
  * CombineBot makes use of many external APIs to bring you their data in easy to access ways, such as Urban Dictionary info and HTTP animal pictures.

* Updated often with 30+ slash commands!
  * I try to update this bot as often as I can when not working on other projects or when real life is not getting in the way.

* Made FOR the people!
  * When designing this bot, I took into account a lot of things I personally would like to see added into discord personally (such as users making embeds) and allowing people to access useful data easily from the comfort of their group chat. (APIs).

* Host your own instance!
  * I openly support people hosting their own instances of the bot, in fact I designed the core of the bot with that in mind with the supplied Dockerfile and an easy to change `discord-info.json` and `package.json` with bot info. So whether you want to rehaul the entire system, or you just think CombineBot is a stupid name (I don't blame you), then you can easily change that for your server.

## How do I add it to my server?
